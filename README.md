# Welcome to my MERN stack project!
This is **Expense Tracker**, a MERN stack application. 


# How to set up and run this app?

1. Create a mongodb atlas database. You can use [this link](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) to do so.
2. Make sure to create a **.env** file in the backend root directory (server), and add the db connection string in there.
3. In the **.env** file, add the port number as well.
4. CD into the project directories (server AND client).
5. Run **npm install** to install all the dependencies in both of those directories.
6. After you CD to the server directory, run **npm run dev** to run the backend api.
7. After you CD to the client directory, run **npm run dev** to run the frontend application.
